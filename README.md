# DIY Racecar Telemetry System

## Description
This project is a DIY racecar telemetry system built using Arduino. It allows you to collect and analyze data from your racecar, providing valuable insights for performance optimization.

## Features
- Real-time data collection: Collect data such as speed, RPM, throttle position, and more from your racecar.
- Wireless transmission: Transmit the collected data wirelessly to a receiver unit for analysis.
- Data visualization: Visualize the collected data using graphs and charts for easy analysis.

## Components
- Arduino Mega: Used as the main controller for data collection and transmission.
- Arduino Uno: Receives and processes the transmitted data for analysis.
- Sensors: Various sensors to measure speed, RPM, throttle position, and other relevant parameters.
- Wireless module: Enables wireless transmission of data to a receiver unit.
